            I’m a self-taught front-end developer with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. My journey began with curiosity and a desire to understand how web pages are built. Through online resources, hands-on projects, and constant experimentation, I’ve developed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. For the back-end, I’ve worked with Firebase and Supabase to create dynamic, data-driven applications. I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and turning creative ideas into functional websites. My goal is to always deliver clear, responsive, and engaging web experiences.
